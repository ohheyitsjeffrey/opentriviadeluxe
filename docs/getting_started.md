# Getting Started

## Install

### Ubuntu

1. Install Docker.  Digital Ocean has lovely instructions for this at [Install Docker On Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04).

2. ***IMPORTANT!**  Be sure to do the optional **Step 2***, as scripts may assume you can run docker as your regular user and not root.

3. Install Docker Compose to orchestrate the containers locally.  On Ubuntu this should get you everything you need.

```
pip3 install docker-compose
```

### MacOs

1. (Install Docker Desktop On Mac)[https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/].  Docker desktop for mac comes with Docker Compose, so you should be all set with these instructions.

### Running


1. From the project root, Pull base images and build the containers with docker-compose

```
docker-compose build
```

2. Still from the project root, launch the application with

```
docker-compose up
```
